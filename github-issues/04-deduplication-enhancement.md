# Enhanced Deduplication: Prevent Cross-Source Duplicates

## Overview
Improve deduplication logic to prevent duplicate properties from Domain and REA sources while preserving unique entries.

## Tasks
- [ ] Analyze current deduplication logic
- [ ] Implement cross-source duplicate detection
- [ ] Add fuzzy matching for similar addresses
- [ ] Create deduplication report/logging
- [ ] Test with sample data from both sources
- [ ] Optimize database queries for deduplication

## Technical Details
- Use enhanced unique constraint [address, auctionDate, source]
- Implement address normalization for better matching
- Add similarity scoring for potential duplicates
- Create admin interface for manual duplicate resolution

## Acceptance Criteria
- No duplicate properties from same source
- Intelligent handling of similar properties from different sources
- Deduplication reports for monitoring
- Performance optimization for large datasets
- Manual override capability for edge cases
