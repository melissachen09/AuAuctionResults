## 📈 Monitoring Checklist

### 🔍 **1. Application Health Monitoring**

#### Dashboard Accessibility
- **URL:** https://au-auction-results-e3xe7eusq-yqm0nk3ys-projects.vercel.app/dashboard
- **Expected Status:** 200 OK
- **Key Features to Test:**
  - Individual property display loads
  - Search functionality works
  - Filters apply correctly
  - Pagination functions
  - External property links work

#### API Endpoint Health
- **Primary Endpoint:** `/api/suburbs`
- **Enhanced Parameters:** search, suburb, state, result, propertyType, dateFrom, dateTo, priceMin, priceMax
- **Expected Response:** Individual properties with propertyUrl field
- **Monitoring Command:**
  ```bash
  curl "https://au-auction-results-e3xe7eusq-yqm0nk3ys-projects.vercel.app/api/suburbs?limit=1"
  ```

### 🗄️ **2. Database Health Monitoring**

#### Schema Validation
- **New Field:** `propertyUrl` in Auction model
- **Enhanced Constraint:** `[address, auctionDate, source]`
- **New Indexes:** suburb+state, result, propertyType
- **Migration Status:** Check if 20250106 migration applied

#### Data Quality Checks
```sql
-- Check property URL coverage
SELECT 
  source,
  COUNT(*) as total_properties,
  COUNT(propertyUrl) as with_urls,
  ROUND(COUNT(propertyUrl) * 100.0 / COUNT(*), 2) as url_coverage_percent
FROM Auction 
GROUP BY source;

-- Check cross-source deduplication
SELECT address, auctionDate, COUNT(*) as sources
FROM Auction 
GROUP BY address, auctionDate 
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Verify new indexes exist
SELECT indexname FROM pg_indexes 
WHERE tablename = 'Auction' 
AND indexname LIKE '%suburb_state%' 
OR indexname LIKE '%result%' 
OR indexname LIKE '%propertyType%';
```

### 🕷️ **3. Scraper Performance Monitoring**

#### Target Source Coverage
Monitor scraping success from all 13 sources:

**Domain Cities (5):**
- Sydney: https://www.domain.com.au/auction-results/sydney/
- Melbourne: https://www.domain.com.au/auction-results/melbourne/
- Brisbane: https://www.domain.com.au/auction-results/brisbane/
- Adelaide: https://www.domain.com.au/auction-results/adelaide/
- Canberra: https://www.domain.com.au/auction-results/canberra/

**REA States (8):**
- https://www.realestate.com.au/auction-results/vic
- https://www.realestate.com.au/auction-results/nsw
- https://www.realestate.com.au/auction-results/qld
- https://www.realestate.com.au/auction-results/sa

- https://www.realestate.com.au/auction-results/nt
- https://www.realestate.com.au/auction-results/act
- https://www.realestate.com.au/auction-results/tas

#### Scraper Health Metrics
```sql
-- Check recent scraping activity
SELECT 
  source,
  status,
  COUNT(*) as runs,
  AVG(recordCount) as avg_records,
  MAX(startTime) as last_run
FROM ScrapeLog 
WHERE startTime > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY source, status;

-- Monitor property URL extraction success
SELECT 
  DATE(createdAt) as date,
  source,
  COUNT(*) as total_properties,
  COUNT(propertyUrl) as with_urls
FROM Auction 
WHERE createdAt > NOW() - INTERVAL '7 days'
GROUP BY DATE(createdAt), source
ORDER BY date DESC;
```

### 📱 **4. User Experience Monitoring**

#### Dashboard Performance Metrics
- **Page Load Time:** < 3 seconds
- **Search Response Time:** < 1 second
- **API Response Time:** < 500ms

#### Search Functionality Tests
```javascript
// Test search parameters
const searchTests = [
  '/api/suburbs?search=collins street',
  '/api/suburbs?suburb=melbourne&state=VIC',
  '/api/suburbs?result=sold&priceMin=500000',
  '/api/suburbs?propertyType=house&bedrooms=3',
  '/api/suburbs?dateFrom=2024-01-01&sortBy=price'
];

// Each should return individual properties with propertyUrl
```
