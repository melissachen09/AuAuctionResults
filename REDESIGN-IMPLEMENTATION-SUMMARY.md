  - `suburb_state_idx` for suburb and state filtering
  - `result_idx` for result filtering  
  - `propertyType_idx` for property type filtering

## Database Migration Required

To apply the schema changes, run:
```bash
# When database is available
npx prisma migrate deploy

# Or apply the migration manually using the SQL file:
# prisma/migrations/20250106_add_property_url_and_enhanced_indexes/migration.sql
```

## Target URLs Now Supported

## Next Steps

1. **Deploy database migration** to production
2. **Test scrapers** with new URL extraction functionality

5. **Create GitHub issues** from the generated markdown files for project tracking

The redesign successfully transforms the application from suburb-aggregated statistics to individual property tracking with comprehensive search and filtering capabilities.
